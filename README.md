# Token-Creator
A Java program to break the data from a file into tokens

This Java program takes the data from a file and breaks it down into tokens. The tokens contain alphabets, numbers and alphanumerics.
Here I have used a '.txt' file as input but you can use any file by specifying the name and location of that particular file.
This code also provides us the frequency of occurrence of each token in the whole data present in the file.

Note: This program works for simple data forms such as sentences and paragraphs but not for complex ones such as tables and infographics.

Any queries/doubts regarding the code?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to solve them as soon as possible.
